# cicd-demo
This repo is for demoing CI/CD in a Databricks env.

There are a number of ways to set up a CI/CD pattern at your discretion:
 - DABs or Databricks Asset Bundles
 - API
 - Terraform (convenient IaaS that leverages the extensive API)

**There are opinionated ways of achieving CI/CD and it's up to your team to determine the 'right' way.**
